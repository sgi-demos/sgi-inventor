INTRODUCTION

	These notes briefly describe the structure of the Open Inventor
	source tree and how it can be built.

	For the latest news concerning Open Inventor, please consult the

TREE STRUCTURE

	The source tree containing the Open Inventor source is structured as
	follows:

		apps     - sample programs and examples
		data     - sample data
		doc      - reference manual pages
		lib      - Inventor database, interaction, and nodekit source
		libSoXt  - Inventor Xt components and viewers source
		make     - makefile definitions and rules
		tools    - preprocessor for generating shape source files
		libimage - library to read SGI RGB files
		libFL    - font library (IRIX, Linux ix86, and Solaris only).
			   Includes source code for Ang Bodhi's FreeType
			   interface.  For more information, visit

DEPENDENCIES

	The source in its current form will compile on IRIX, Linux ix86/ia64,
	and Apple Darwin (Mac OS X).

	Currently the only dependencies include OpenGL (R), X11R6, and
	Motif (R) 1.2x.  See the FAQ file for more detailed information.


BUILDING THE TREE

	1) Set the environment variable IVROOT to point to the root directory
	   for the installed libraries and binaries, e.g.

		setenv IVROOT /usr/local/src

	2) Append the DSO installation directory to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	   environment variable, i.e.

		setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "$LD_LIBRARY_PATH":$IVROOT/usr/lib

	   On Apple Darwin (Mac OS X), use DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH instead.

	3) The source code is compiled with optimization enabled by default.
	   To create debug libraries, enter:

		setenv LIBTYPE debug

	4) To use the FreeType interface instead of the default font library,
	   enter:

		setenv FREETYPE 1

	5) Type 'gmake install' in the directory where the source code was
	   unpacked.

	6) To use the default font library, run the linkType1.sh script in
	   libFL/src as root.  Type1 PFA font files must already exist in
	   /usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1.

	   To use the FreeType interface, set the FL_FONT_PATH environment
	   variable to the directory where TrueType fonts are installed
	   (defaults to /usr/share/data/fonts) and run the linkTrueType.sh
	   script in libFL/freetype as root.


INSTALLATION TREE STRUCTURE

	When typing 'gmake install' the files generated during the
	build will end up in the following locations:

		$(IVROOT)/usr/bin		- executables (e.g. ivview)
		$(IVROOT)/usr/include/Inventor	- include files (.h)
		$(IVROOT)/usr/lib		- shared libraries (.so)
		$(IVROOT)/usr/lib/InventorDebug	- debug shared libraries (.so)
		$(IVROOT)/usr/man		- man pages 
		$(IVROOT)/usr/share/data	- 3D models
		$(IVROOT)/usr/demos/Inventor	- miscellaneous SGI demos


THANKS

	Special thanks goes out to all the original Open Inventor
	developers, especially Paul Strauss and Gavin Bell for
	graciously agreeing to act in an ongoing advisory capacity
	at this exciting moment in Open Inventor's history.

	We would also like to thank Chris Insinger and Jenny Zhao
	for their unwavering support and persistence.  Without them
	this open source project would not have happened.
