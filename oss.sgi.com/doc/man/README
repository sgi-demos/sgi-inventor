This directory contains the Inventor man pages.

Note that Inventor man pages are created using a custom Inventor program
called `ivman'.  We have designed a simple language which we use to write
our original man pages in (*.ivm) and then run `ivman' to generate
a standard Unix man page (TROFF).  We ONLY edit the .ivm files found in
man3/ivm/* - NOT the *.3 files.

Note however, that we write standard Unix man pages for the commands
and demos found in man/man1 (e.g., ivcat).
