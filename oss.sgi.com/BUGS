The problems described below occur on Linux platforms we tested.  Note that
some of these may be due to older versions of other libraries, i.e. LessTif or
Mesa.

1. Font capabilities used by SoAsciiText and SoText[23] are currently provided
   by libFL.a.  On IRIX, libFL.so is provided in the eoe.sw.gfx and
   eoe.sw64.gfx subsystems.  A version of libFL.a compiled for SunOS 5.8 is
   available in the FTP download area.  No other platforms are currently
   supported.  Look in the README file for more information on using Ang
   Bodhi's FreeType interface.

2. Arrowhead cones in transformer dragger appear squished.  This occurs on
   IRIX and Linux.

3. When selecting hidden-line view in viewers, the following error is printed
   for models with colors specified in arrays:

     Inventor error in SoIndexedShape(): material index n is out of range 0 - 1

   This occurs on IRIX and Linux.

4. SceneViewer crashes when loading temple.iv (binary format).  This occurs
   with LessTif 0.91.4, but not 0.90.0, nor with OpenMotif 2.2.2-5; refer to

     http://oss.sgi.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2

5. SoXtFullViewer popup menu appears only at first invocation.  This occurs
   with LessTif, but not with OpenMotif; refer to
