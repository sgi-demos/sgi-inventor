%description
The Open Inventor 3D Toolkit is an object-oriented toolkit that simplifies and
abstracts the task of writing graphics programming into a set of easy to use
objects.  These objects range from low-level data-centered objects such as
Sphere, Camera, Material, Light, and Group, to high-level application-level
objects such as Walk Viewer and Material Editor.  The foundation concept in
Inventor is the "scene database" which defines the objects to be used in an
application.  When using Inventor, a programmer creates, edits, and composes
these objects into hierarchical 3D scene graphs (i.e. database).  A variety of
fundamental application tasks such as rendering, picking, event handling, and
file reading/writing are built-in operations of all objects in the database and
thus are simple to invoke.

This distribution installs shared libraries in /usr/lib, applications in
/usr/bin, and man pages in /usr/man/man1.
