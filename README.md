## SGI Inventor
_SGI Inventor source and binaries archive_

This will be a collection of all open source Open Inventor versions.  Eventually I'd like to do an Emscripten port, as there are a few fun demos I'd like to preserve.  Gathering up the raw materials here to do that.

For now, this just contains SGI's oss.sgi.com Inventor source, pulled from [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20171010104743/http://oss.sgi.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/inventor/) using [cvsweb-extract](https://github.com/sgi-demos/cvsweb-extract).
